Control of a Simulated Robotic arm using ROS, V-REP, C++ and Computer Vision

A Robotic Arm is on top of a Omnirover that is able to move in a restricted area. 
The objective is to simulate a system that is able to detect screw holes with a camera and perform the assembly on a metal sheet. 

The sawyer and omnipad files are lua scripts and must be in the V-REP environments folder.
